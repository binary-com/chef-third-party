## 2.1.0 (2018-07-18)

- Test with Local Delivery instead of Rake

- the search stanza should be an array rather than a single element.  resolv.conf search allows up to six search domains to be defined.  Have updated the recipes with some rules (no more than 6 domains or 256 chars), change the ['resolver']['search'] into an array and changed teh template unless block to search for an empty array instead
