Datadog Cookbook
================

Chef recipes to deploy Datadog's components and configuration automatically.

This cookbook includes support for:

* Datadog Agent version 7.x (default)
* Datadog Agent version 6.x
* Datadog Agent version 5.x

Log collection is available with Agent v6/v7, please refer to the [inline docs](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L401-L406) to enable it.

*Note: This README may refer to features that are not released yet. Please check the README of the
git tag/the gem version you're using for your version's documentation*

Requirements
============

- chef-client >= 12.7

If you need support for Chef < 12.7, please consider using a [release 2.x of the cookbook](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog/releases/tag/v2.18.0).
See the CHANGELOG for more info.

Platforms
---------

* Amazon Linux
* CentOS
* Debian
* RedHat (RHEL 8 requires chef >= 15)
* Scientific Linux
* Ubuntu
* Windows
* SUSE (requires chef >= 13.3)

Cookbooks
---------

The following Opscode cookbooks are dependencies:

* `apt`
* `chef_handler`
* `yum`

Version `7.1` or later of the `apt` cookbook is needed to install the Agent on Debian 9 or later.

### Chef support

**Chef 13 users**

- If you're using Chef 13 and chef_handler 1.x, you may have trouble using the
dd-handler recipe. The known workaround is to update your dependency to `chef_handler >= 2.1`.

**Chef 14 and 15 users**:

- In order to support Chef 12 and 13, the `datadog` cookbook has a dependency to
the `chef_handler` cookbook which is now shipped as a resource in Chef 14.
Unfortunately, it will display a deprecation message to Chef 14 and 15 users.

Upgrading to version 4.x of the cookbook
========================================

Some attributes have changed their names from version 3.x to 4.x of this cookbook. Use this reference table to update your configuration:

| Action | Cookbook 3.x  | Cookbook 4.x  |
|---|---|---|
| Install Agent 7.x | Not supported |  `'agent_major_version' => 7` |
| Install Agent 6.x | `'agent6' => true`  |  `'agent_major_version' => 6` |
| Install Agent 5.x | `'agent6' => false`  |  `'agent_major_version' => 5` |
| Pin agent version | `'agent_version'` or `'agent6_version'`  |  `'agent_version'` for all versions |
| Change package_action | `'agent_package_action'` or `'agent6_package_action'`  |  `'agent_package_action'` for all versions |
| Change APT repo URL | `'aptrepo'` or `'agent6_aptrepo'`  |  `'aptrepo'` for all versions |
| Change APT repo dist | `'aptrepo_dist'` or `'agent6_aptrepo_dist'`  |  `'aptrepo_dist'` for all versions |
| Change YUM repo | `'yumrepo'` or `'agent6_yumrepo'` |  `'yumrepo'` for all versions |
| Change SUSE repo | `'yumrepo_suse'` or `'agent6_yumrepo_suse'` |  `'yumrepo_suse'` for all versions |

## Example

If you had an Agent 6 installation, the same configuration will now look like this:

```ruby
default_attributes(
  'datadog' => {
    'agent_major_version' => 6,          # was 'agent6' => true,
    'agent_version' => '6.10.0',         # was 'agent6_version' => '6.10.0',
    'agent_package_action' => 'install', # was 'agent6_package_action' => 'install',
  }
)
```
Usage
=====

By default, the current major version (4.x) of this cookbook installs Agent v7.

Attributes are available to have finer control over which version of the Agent you install:

 * `agent_major_version`: allows you to pin the major version of the agent to 5, 6 or 7 (default).
 * `agent_version`: allows you to pin a specific agent version (recommended).
 * `agent_package_action` (Linux only): Defaults to `'install'`, can be set `'upgrade'` to get automatic agent updates (we recommend you keep the default here and instead change the pinned `agent_version` to upgrade).

Please review the [attributes/default.rb](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog/blob/master/attributes/default.rb) file (at the version of the cookbook you use) for the full list and usage of the attributes used by the cookbook.

For general information on the Datadog Agent, please refer to the [datadog-agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/) repo.

#### Extra configuration

Should you wish to add additional elements to the Agent v6 configuration file
(typically `datadog.yaml`) that are not directly available
as attributes of the cookbook, you may use the `node['datadog']['extra_config']`
attribute. This attribute is a hash and will be marshaled into the configuration
file accordingly.

E.g.

```ruby
 default_attributes(
   'datadog' => {
     'extra_config' => {
       'secret_backend_command' => '/sbin/local-secrets'
     }
   }
 )
```
or
```
default['datadog']['extra_config']['secret_backend_command'] = '/sbin/local-secrets'
```

This example will set the field `secret_backend_command` in the configuration
file `datadog.yaml`.

For nested attributes, use object syntax:

E.g.

```ruby
default['datadog']['extra_config']['logs_config'] = { 'use_port_443' => true }
```

This example will set the field `logs_config` in the configuration file `datadog.yaml`.

### Using Agent v6 or v5

You can still setup the Agent v6 by setting `node['datadog']['agent_major_version']` to 6.

Note that `agent_major_version` and `agent_version` should be kept consistent.

```ruby
  default_attributes(
    'datadog' => {
      'agent_major_version' => 6
    }
  )
```

The same works for version 5.

### Agent v5 transitions

#### Upgrade from Agent v6 to Agent v7

To upgrade from an already installed Agent v6 to Agent v7, you'll have to either:

* Set `agent_major_version` to `7`, `agent_package_action` to `install` and pin a specific v7 version as `agent_version` (recommended).
* Set `agent_major_version` to `7` and `agent_package_action` to `upgrade`.

```ruby
  default_attributes(
    'datadog' => {
      'agent_major_version' => 7,
      'agent_version' => '7.15.0',
      'agent_package_action' => 'install',
    }
  )
```

The same applies if upgrading from 5 to 6.

#### Downgrade from an installed Agent v7 to an Agent v6

You will need to indicate that you want to setup an Agent v6 instead of v7, pin the Agent v6 version that you want to install and allow downgrade:

```ruby
  default_attributes(
    'datadog' => {
      'agent_major_version' => 6,
      'agent_version' => '6.10.0',
      'agent_allow_downgrade' => true
    }
  )
```

The same works for version 5.

### Instructions

1. Add this cookbook to your Chef Server, either by installing with knife or by adding it to your Berksfile:
  ```
  cookbook 'datadog', '~> 4.0.0'
  ```
2. Add your API Key either:
  * as a node attribute via an `environment` or `role`, or
  * as a node attribute by declaring it in another cookbook at a higher precedence level, or
  * in the node `run_state` by setting `node.run_state['datadog']['api_key']` in another cookbook preceding `datadog`'s recipes in the run_list. This approach has the benefit of not storing the credential in clear text on the Chef Server.
3. Create an 'application key' for `chef_handler` [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api), and add it as a node attribute or in the run state, as in Step #2.

   NB: if you're using the run state to store the api and app keys you need to set them at compile time before `datadog::dd-handler` in the run list.

4. Enable Agent integrations by including their recipes and configuration details in your roleâ€™s run-list and attributes.
   Note that you can also create additional integrations recipes by using the `datadog_monitor` resource.
5. Associate the recipes with the desired `roles`, i.e. "role:chef-client" should contain "datadog::dd-handler" and a "role:base" should start the agent with "datadog::dd-agent". Here's an example role with both recipes plus the MongoDB integration enabled.
  ```ruby
  name 'example'
  description 'Example role using DataDog'

  default_attributes(
    'datadog' => {
      'agent_major_version' => 7,
      'api_key' => 'api_key',
      'application_key' => 'app_key',
      'mongo' => {
        'instances' => [
          {'host' => 'localhost', 'port' => '27017'}
        ]
      }
    }
  )

  run_list %w(
    recipe[datadog::dd-agent]
    recipe[datadog::dd-handler]
    recipe[datadog::mongo]
  )
  ```

6. Wait until `chef-client` runs on the target node (or trigger chef-client manually if you're impatient)

We are not making use of data_bags in this recipe at this time, as it is unlikely that you will have more than one API key and one application key.

For more deployment details, visit the [Datadog Documentation site](http://docs.datadoghq.com/).

### Chef 12

Depending of the Chef 12 version you're using, you will have to add some extra
dependency contraints.

#### Chef < 12.14

```ruby
depends 'yum', '< 5.0'
```

#### Chef < 12.9

```ruby
depends 'apt', '< 6.0.0'
depends 'yum', '< 5.0'
```

AWS OpsWorks Chef Deployment
----------------------------

1. Add Chef Custom JSON:
  ```json
  {"datadog":{"agent_major_version": 7, "api_key": "<API_KEY>", "application_key": "<APP_KEY>"}}
  ```

2. Include the recipe in install-lifecycle recipe:
  ```ruby
  include_recipe 'datadog::dd-agent'
  ```


Recipes
=======

default
-------
Just a placeholder for now, when we have more shared components they will probably live there.

dd-agent
--------
Installs the Datadog agent on the target system, sets the API key, and start the service to report on the local system metrics

**Notes for Windows**:

* Because of changes in the Windows Agent packaging and install in version 5.12.0, when upgrading the Agent from versions <= 5.10.1 to versions >= 5.12.0,
  please set the `windows_agent_use_exe` attribute to `true`.

  Once the upgrade is complete, you can leave the attribute to its default value (`false`).

  For more information on these Windows packaging changes, see the related [docs on the dd-agent wiki](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Windows-Agent-Installation).

dd-handler
----------
Installs the [chef-handler-datadog](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-handler-datadog) gem and invokes the handler at the end of a Chef run to report the details back to the newsfeed.

dogstatsd-ruby
-----------------------
Installs the language-specific libraries to interact with `dogstatsd`.

For ruby, please use the `datadog::dogstatsd-ruby` recipe.

For Python, please add a dependency on the `poise-python` cookbook to your custom/wrapper cookbook, and use the following resource:
  ```ruby
  python_package 'dogstatsd-python' # assumes that python and pip are installed
  ```
  For more advanced usage, please refer to the [`poise-python` cookbook documentation](https://github.com/poise/poise-python)

ddtrace-ruby
---------------------
Installs the language-specific libraries for application Traces (APM).

For ruby, please use the `datadog::ddtrace-ruby` recipe.

For Python, please add a dependency on the `poise-python` cookbook to your custom/wrapper cookbook, and use the following resource:
  ```ruby
  python_package 'ddtrace' # assumes that python and pip are installed
  ```
  For more advanced usage, please refer to the [`poise-python` cookbook documentation](https://github.com/poise/poise-python)

other
-----
There are many other integration-specific recipes, that are meant to assist in deploying the correct agent configuration files and dependencies for a given integration.

Resources
=========

datadog_monitor
---------------

The `datadog_monitor` resource will help you to enable Agent integrations.

The default action `:add` enables the integration by filling a configuration file for the integration with the values provided to the resource, setting the correct permissions on that file, and restarting the Agent.

The `:remove` action disables an integration.

### Syntax

```ruby
datadog_monitor 'name' do
  init_config                       Hash # default value: {}
  instances                         Array # default value: []
  logs                              Array # default value: []
  use_integration_template          true, false # default value: false
  action                            Symbol # defaults to :add if not specified
end
```

#### Actions

* `:add` Default. Enable the integration.
* `:remove` Use this action to disable the integration.

#### Properties

* `'name'` is the name of the Agent integration to configure and enable
* `instances` are the fields used to fill values under the `instances` section in the integration configuration file.
* `init_config` are the fields used to fill values under the the `init_config` section in the integration configuration file.
* `logs` are the fields used to fill values under the the `logs` section in the integration configuration file.
* `use_integration_template`: set to `true` (recommended) to use a default template that simply writes the values of `instances`, `init_config`and `logs` in YAML under their respective YAML keys. (defaults to `false` for backward compatibility, will default to `true` in a future major version of the cookbook)

### Example

This example enables the ElasticSearch integration by using the `datadog_monitor` resource. It provides the instance configuration (in this case: the url to connect to ElasticSearch) and sets the `use_integration_template` flag to use the default configuration template. Also, it notifies the `service[datadog-agent]` resource in order to restart the Agent.

Note that the Agent installation needs to be earlier in the run list.

```ruby
include_recipe 'datadog::dd-agent'

datadog_monitor 'elastic'
  instances  [{'url' => 'http://localhost:9200'}]
  use_integration_template true
  notifies :restart, 'service[datadog-agent]' if node['datadog']['agent_start']
end
```

See `recipes/` for many examples using the `datadog_monitor` resource.

datadog_integration
---------------

The `datadog_integration` resource will help you to install specific versions
of Datadog integrations.

The default action `:install` installs the integration on the node using the
`agent integration install` command.

The `:remove` action removes an integration from the node using the `agent
integration remove` command.

### Syntax

```ruby
datadog_integration 'name' do
  version                           String # version to install for :install action.
  action                            Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified
end
```

#### Actions

* `:install` Default. Installs an integration in the given version.
* `:remove` Removes an integration.

#### Properties

* `'name'` is the name of the Agent integration to install, e.g. `datadog-apache`
* `version` is the version of the integration that you want to install. Only needed
with the `:install` action.

### Example

This example installs version `1.11.0` of the ElasticSearch integration by
using the `datadog_integration` resource.

Note that the Agent installation needs to be earlier in the run list.

```ruby
include_recipe 'datadog::dd-agent'

datadog_integration 'datadog-elastic'
  version '1.11.0'
end
```

In order to get the available versions of the integrations, please refer to
their `CHANGELOG.md` file in the [integrations-core repository](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core).

**Note for Chef Windows users**: as the datadog-agent binary available on the
node is used by this resource, the chef-client must have read access to the
`datadog.yaml` file.


Development
===========

To contribute, you will have to follow the contribution guide in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Dependencies

First, you should use [bundler](https://bundler.io) and the provided Gemfile to install the development and release dependencies.

After having installed bundler, you can run the following command to install gem in a vendored folder:

```bash
bundle install --path .bundle
```

### Testing

This project uses [rspec](https://rspec.info/) as its unit tests engine. It uses the related `chefspec` gem to abstract the chef logic. Some Chef specs can fail if you don't use the right version of Chef so be careful to use the one pinned in the Gemfile. To run unit tests, you can use:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

### Integration testing

This project uses [kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/) as its integration tests engine. To really verify integration tests, you should have [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed on your machine.

Kitchen allows you to test specific recipes described in [kitchen.yml](./kitchen.yml) across all platforms and versions that are also described in the same file. Each combination of recipe x platform x version is a test target.

To list available targets, you can use the `list` command:

```bash
bundle exec kitchen list
```

To test a specific target, you can run:

```bash
bundle exec kitchen test <target>
```

So for example, if you want to test the CouchDB monitor on Ubuntu 16.04, you can run:

```bash
bundle exec kitchen test datadog-couchdb-ubuntu-1604-15
```

As there is a CouchDB recipe described in the `kitchen.yml`, and an Ubuntu platform with the 16.04 version.

More information about kitchen on its [Getting Started](https://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/introduction/).

### Development loop

To develop some fixes or some features, the easiest way is to work on the platform and version of your choice, setting the machine up with the `create` command and applying the recipe with the `converge` command. If you want to explore the machine and try different things, you can also login into the machine with the `login` command.

Please note that the `login` command only works on Linux & OSX and that you will have to connect to the VM through Virtual Box's interface on Windows. (Or via putty or similar ssh client)

N.B.: The credentials of the created virtual machines are login `vagrant`, password `vagrant`.

```bash
# Create the relevant vagrant virtual machine
bundle exec kitchen create datadog-couchdb-ubuntu-1604-15

# Converge to test your recipe
bundle exec kitchen converge datadog-couchdb-ubuntu-1604-15

# Login to your machine to check stuff
bundle exec kitchen login datadog-couchdb-ubuntu-1604-15

# Verify the integration tests for your machine
bundle exec kitchen verify datadog-couchdb-ubuntu-1604-15

# Clean your machine
bundle exec kitchen destroy datadog-couchdb-ubuntu-1604-15
```

It is advised that you work in TDD and that you write tests before making changes so that developing your feature or fix is just making tests pass.
