# This recipe is intended as an example of just one possible bridge
# configuration for ml2 and should not be used as is in production. The
# openstack-network cookbook tries to provide all the basic  features to deploy
# the neutron services, but can not include all possible network and bridge
# configurations out there. To use the openstack-network cookbook in production,
# please create a wrapper to configure your network interfaces and adapt the
# configs accordingly. You should find fitting examples given below.

# Make Openstack object available in Chef::Recipe

# Helper for creating dummy interfaces for ovs bridges on jenkins test nodes and
# in testing vagrant boxes.
# The created interfaces do not work for real network traffic, but are needed to
# test the bridge creation and usage in the recipes.
# This needs to be done during compile time to ensure that the address_for
# method used lateron works
